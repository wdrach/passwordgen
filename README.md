passwordgen
===========

# Info

Password gen is extremely straightforward. You run it (Python 3) and it gives you 4 random words that are length 7 or lower. This type of password scheme is really high entropy while still being easy to remember. It is based off of the [correct horse battery staple XKCD](http://xkcd.com/936/). I highly suggest you pick and choose your passwords, if you just chose to go with 4 2 letter words then it won't really do its purpose. Choose the funny ones and throw out the rest

You can also generate multiple passwords by passing it a number e.g. `passwordgen 50` which allows you to pick and choose more.
